It can also have some useful insight for real estate companies, existing businesses, communities, and individuals.\n</p>"

They're some missing data, for example, rows with no assigned borough and neighborhood were dropped. While rows with postal code and borough, but no neighborhood, the neighborhood was set the same as its borough.\nAs for the crime dataset, the crime for each community was obtained, and cleaned by dropping any row that was not assigned.\nWe will then use a foursquare API to explore the different neighborhoods and boroughs to gain insight. Then we will do farther analysis by merging the two datasets for more in-depth insight.\n</p>\n"
